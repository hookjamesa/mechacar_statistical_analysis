## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

After an analysis of the provided data, the following variables were found to be statistically significant for determining the linear regression of mpg:

* Vehicle_Length and
* Ground_Clearance.

With both coefficients being positive and consistent in direction, the author considers the slope as positive as well. However, the author does not believe that this is a conclusive model to predict MPG for MechaCars, as the R-squared value (0.7149) is too low to show strong correlation. It certainly shows some correlation based on the provided data set, but further investigation is warranted.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Current manufacturing data shows that all cars in total meet this requirement, however lots from manufacturing lot 3 independently do not. The author suggests that manufacturing lot 3 is investigated to see what manufacturing methods fell out of spec and why.
