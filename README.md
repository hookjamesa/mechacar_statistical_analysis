## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

After an analysis of the provided data, the following variables were found to be statistically significant for determining the linear regression of mpg:

* Vehicle_Length and
* Ground_Clearance.

With both coefficients being positive and consistent in direction, the author considers the slope as positive as well. However, the author does not believe that this is a conclusive model to predict MPG for MechaCars, as the R-squared value (0.7149) is too low to show strong correlation. It certainly shows some correlation based on the provided data set, but further investigation is warranted.
